<h1>Regression Project<a class="headerlink" href="#regression-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this project, your goal is to build regression models of housing prices. The models should learn from data and be able to predict the median house price in a district (which is a population of 600 to 3000 people), given some predictor variable</p>
<p>Das Vorgehen in diesem Notebook orientiert sich am Data Science Lifecycle.
Es wird eine Modellpräzision von &gt; 70% gewünscht. Das bedeutet, dass der R-squared Wert des besten Modells &gt;0,7 sein soll.</p>

<p>Beim Sichten der Datensätze fällt auf, dass im ersten Datensatz zwei Unstimmigkeiten im Vergleich zu den anderen Datensätzen vorliegen: <br>
<em>median_house_value</em> ist nur hier mit der Währung Dollar angegeben und hinter <em>housing_median_age</em> steht der Zusatz “years”.</p>
<p>Nun folgt Pandas Dataframe Info Methode. Diese zeigt die Variablen und deren Datentypen, sowie die Anzahl der non-null values je Spalte an.</p>

<p>Die Variablen <em>housing_median_age</em> und und <em>median_house_value</em> wurden als Datentyp <em>object</em> definiert. Dies muss genauer untersucht werden, da bei einer Jahreszahl bzw. einem monetären Wert ein numerischer Datentyp (int oder float) angemessener ist. Die Ursache hierfür ist auf die Zusatzangaben “$” und “years” zurückzuführen. <br>
Die Varialben <em>ocean_proximity</em> und <em>price_category</em> sind keine numerischen sondern kategoriale Datentypen. Diese lassen sich jeweils in einer internen Rangordnung anordnen. Sie sind daher ordinal. Der richtige Datentyp hierfür ist <em>category</em>. Die Transformation der Datentypen erfolgt in Kapitel “Data Transformation”. <br>
Neben den Datentypen wird auch die Anzahl der non-null values je Variable angezeigt. Hier haben alle Variablen eine Anzahl von 20640 non-null values. Lediglich die Variable <em>total_bedrooms</em> liegt unter diesem Wert. Dies lässt darauf schließen, dass hier einige Datensätze keinen Wert haben. Dies gilt es im Folgenden genauer zu untersuchen.</p>

<p>Wie bereits vermutet, enthält die Variable <em>total_bedrooms</em> 207 null values. Die Abbildung visualisiert diese nicht befüllten Datensätze und deren Verteilung im Datenset in gelb. Die null-values sind zufällig im Datenset verteilt. Da das Datenset über 20000 Datensätze enthält, werden die Zeilen mit den null-values im Kapitel Transform Data entfernt. Alternativ wäre auch eine Belegung der null-values beispielsweise mit dem Durchschnittswert der Variable möglich. Darauf wird hier jedoch verzichtet, genug andere Datensätze vorliegen.</p>

<p>Mithilfe der string replace Methode werden die zuvor identifizierten Zeichen “years” und “$” entfernt. Anschließend ist eine Transformation der Features in integer bzw. float Werte möglich. Für <em>housing_median_age</em> wird integer gewählt, da die Jahreszahlen als Ganze Zahlen also discrete Werte angegeben sind. <br>
Für <em>median_house_value</em> wird der Datentyp float benötigt, da die Ergebnisse einer linearen Regression stehts continous sind.</p>

<p>Hier wird die Häufigkeit einzelner Ausprägungen von <em>ocean_proximity</em> dargestellt. Die Ausprägung <em>ISLAND</em> kommt über das gesamte Datenset mit über 20000 Datensätzen nur fünfmal vor. In Relation zur Gesamtanzahl der Datensätzen ist dies sehr wenig, wodurch die Aussagekraft dieser Ausprägung vermutlich eher gering ist. Daher werden die Datensätze mit Ausprägung <em>ISLAND</em> mit der Ausprägung <em>NEAR OCEAN</em> vereint.</p>

<p>Die Datensätze stammen alle aus Kalifornien, USA. <br>
Die Werte Longitude und Latitude unterscheiden sich daher kaum, wie sich auch bereits im Kapitel deskriptive Statistik gezeigt hat.
Daher sind sie als Feature eher ungeeignet. <br>
Allerdings scheint die Entfernung zum Ozean eine wichtige Rolle im Bezug auf den <em>median_house_value</em> zu spielen.
Ocean_proximity scheint daher als feature interessant und sollte genauer untersucht werden.</p>

<p>Die hier abgebildeten, unabhängigen Variablen weisen eine starke Korrelation untereinander auf (bis auf housing_median_age). <br>
In Bezug auf die abhängige Variable <em>median_house_value</em> zeigen die Plots zunächst keinen starken Zusammenhang. <br>
Interessant sieht das Histogramme von <em>median_house_value</em> aus, da es am äußeren rechten Rand nochmal hohe Häufigkeiten haben. Dieses Histogramme wird später nochmal genauer analysisiert.</p>

<em>median_income</em> weist mit einem Wert von 0,69 die höchste Korrelation auf, danach folgen <em>bedrooms_per_rooms</em> mit einer negativen Korrelation in Höhe von -0,25 und anschließend <em>people_per_household</em> ebenfalls mit einer negativen Korrelation in Höhe von -0,18. <br>
Danach folgt <em>rooms_per_household</em>, allerdings kann diese Variable nicht in Kombination mit den beiden zuvor genannten genutzt werden, da sie sich aus <em>total_rooms</em> und <em>households</em> zusammensetzt. Diese Werte werden jedoch bereits in <em>bedrooms_per_rooms</em> und <em>people_per_household</em> verwendet, daher ist die zusätzliche Verwendung von <em>rooms_per_household</em> nicht sinnvoll. <br>
<em>housing_median_age</em> könnte mit einer Korrelation von 0,11 noch einen positiven Einfluss auf das Modell haben.</p>

<p>Auch <em>NEAR COAST</em> und <em>&lt;1H OCEAN</em> zeigen eine ähnliche Verteilung des Medians und der Quartile. Das 3. Quartil von <em>NEAR COAST</em> zieht sich jedoch noch um ca. 50000$ weiter nach oben, als das von <em>&lt;1H OCEAN</em>, daher bleibt die Differenzierung dieser beiden Ausprägungen noch bestehen. <br>
Bei der Ausprägung INLAND sind viele Ausreiser nach oben zu erkennen.</p>

<p>Wie bereits aus der Korrelationsmatrix zu schließen, ist ein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen <em>median_income</em> und <em>median_house_value</em> erkennbar. Die “Linie” mit Datenpunkten bei 500000<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( ergibt sich aus der anzunehmenden Begrenzung der median_house_value_ auf 500000\)</span>. <br>
Auch innerhalb der einzelenden Ausprägungen von <em>ocean_proximity</em> ist eine lineare Korrelation von <em>median_income</em> und <em>median_house_value</em> erkennbar.</p>

<p>Die summary() Methode berechnet die wichtigsten Kennzahlen des Modells. <br>
R-squared ist eine Kennzahl zur Beurteilung der Anpassungsgüte eines Modells und nimmt einen Wert zwischen 0% und 100% an. Als Bezugsbasis wird der Durchschnitt verwendet. <br>
lm erreicht einen R-squared Wert in Höhe von 63,2%. Somit können 63,2% der <em>median_house_value</em> Streuung <br>
In statistischen Methoden wird meist lieber der adjusted R-squared genutzt. Da dieser die degrees of freedom miteinbezieht, lässt sich durch adj. R-squared einen besseren Rückschluss auf die Gesamtpopulation der Datensätze ziehen. Dieser ist meistens etwas schlechter als R-squared. In diesem Modell sind beide Werte gleich hoch. <br>
Mithilfe der Kennzahlen AIC und BIC soll ein overfitting des Modells verhindert werden. Für jedes zusätzliche Feature wird eine “Bestrafung” in die Kennzahlen miteinberechnet. Je kleiner die Werte, desto besser. In diesem Modell sind die Werte jedoch relativ hoch.<br>
F-statistics ist die Menge der systematischen Varianz (MSM) geteilt durch die Menge der unsystematischen Varianz (MSR). Die Kennzahl gibt an, in welcher Höhe das Modell die Ergebnisausgabe der abhängigen Variable verbessert hat, verglichen zu Ungenauigkeit im Modell. Je höher F-statistics, desto besser. Ein F-statistics Wert in Höhe von 5618, wie in Modell lm, ist schon sehr gut. <br>
Der Y-Achsenschnittpunkt des Modells liegt bei 61394,65. Die Steigung der einzelnen Features ist in der Spalte <em>coef</em> abzulesen. Zu interpretieren sind diese folgendermaßen: Vergrößert sich der Wert in Variable <em>median_income</em> um 1 und alle anderen Werte bleiben konstant, so ist das Ergebnis um 42189,93 größer als zuvor. <br>
Die p-values der Features liegen alle bei 0,00. Die Nullhypothese (ß=0 =&gt; Feature hat keinen Einfluss auf die abhängige Variable) kann demnach für alle Features verworfen werden. <br>
Die p-values für Jarque-Bera und Omnibus liegen ebenfalls bei 0,00. Die Nullhypothese, die Fehler seien normalverteilt, wird in diesem Falle verworfen. Es wird also angenommen, die Residuals seien nicht normalverteilt. Bei einer Datensetgröße &gt; 50, kann dies aufgrund des Central Limit Theorems jedoch vernachlässigt werden. <br>
Der Durbin-Watson Wert liegt bei knapp 2. Somit kann angenommen werden, dass die Fehler des Modells keine Korrelation aufweisen.</p>

<p>Mithilfe des Influence Plots werden mögliche Ausreiser als blaue Punkte in der Größe entsprechend ihres Einflusses identifiziert. Dies können Werte mit hoher Abweichung in ihrem Y-Wert (outliers) oder X-Wert (high leverage) sein. In einer linearen Regression können solche Ausreise einen großen Einfluss auf das Gesamtmodell haben und somit die Performance des gesamten Modells erheblich verschlechtern. Als Faustregel werden Datenpunkte mit einer <em>Cooks Distance</em> in Höhe von 4/n (wobei n die Anzahl der Datensätze ist) als mögliche Ausreiser identifiziert.</p>

<p>In diesem Modell werden 963 Datensätze mit einer Cooks Distance &gt; 4/n als mögliche Ausreiser identifiziert. Beispielsweise könnte versucht werden, den Einfluss dieser Datensätze auf das Modell durch Datentransformation (bspw. durch Verwendung des Logarithmus) zu verringern. Allerdings hilft diese Methode der Modellperformance genau so oft, wie sie ihr schadet. Daher wird hier auf eine Datentransformation verzichtet und die Datenpunkte stattdessen aus dem Trainings Set entfernt.</p>

<p>Im Vergleich zum ursprünglichen Trainings Set, welches im Kapitel EDA ausführlich analysiert wurde, wurden einige X- und Y-Ausreiser entfernt. Dadurch hat sich die waagrechte Punktelinie bei 500000$ <em>medin_house_value</em> verkleinert und Ausreiser mit hohen X- und niedrigen Y-Werten wurden entfernt.</p>

<p>Durch die Entfernung der Ausreiser haben sich R-squared, adjusted R-squared und F-statistics deutlich verbessert. <br>
AIC und BIC sind auch etwas kleiner geworden und haben sich somit verbessert. <br>
Die p-values der Features bleiben unverändert. <br>
Auch an den p-values für Jarque-Bera und Omnibus hat sich kaum etwas verändert. <br>
Durbin-Watson liegt nun bei einem Wert &lt;&gt; 2. Generell ist bei einem Wert von &gt; 2 eine negative Korrelation der Modellfehler anzunehmen.</p>

<p>Die Partial Regression Plots visualisieren die Relation einer unabhängigen Variablen in Verbindung mit den anderen abhängigen Variablen im Modell in Bezug auf die abhängige Variable. <br>
Die Plots zeigen eine negative Abhängigkeit von der Ausprägung <em>I.INLAND</em> von <em>ocean_proximity</em> und <em>peope_per_household</em>. <em>Median_income</em> und <em>bedrooms_per_rooms</em> scheinen eine positive Abhängigkeit auf <em>median_house_value</em> zu haben. Gemäß dem Diagramm hat die Variable <em>ocean_proximity[T.NEAR COAST]</em> keinen Einfluss auf <em>median_income</em>. Dies steht im Gegensatz zum p-value 0,00 dieser Variablen, nach dessen Interpretation die Variable einen Einfluss auf die abhängige Variable hat.</p>

<p>Auch diese Plots lassen darauf schließen, dass die Variable _ocean_proximity[T.NEAR COAST] das Modell nicht verbessert. Sowohl Partial Regression Plot als auch CCPR Plot visualisieren eine Nicht-Linearität zwischen der Variablen und <em>median_house_value</em>. <br>
Die Residuals scheinen dagegen gleichmäßig verteilt zu sein.</p>

<p>Die negative Korrelation ist sowohl im Partial Regression Plot als auch im CCPR Plot zu erkennen. Die Residuals sind gleichmäßig verteilt und lassen daher auf Homoskedastizität rückschließen. Das Diagramm zu Y and Fitted vs. X ist aufgrund der vielen Datenpunkte schwer zu analysieren.</p>

<p>Auch hier ist eine negative Abhängigkeit der abhängigen zur unabhängigen Variablen zu erkennen. Linearität scheint also vorzuliegen. Allerdings ist im Residual Plot keine konstante Varianz der Fehlerstreuung zu erkennen. Mit steigendem X-Wert verringert sich die Fehlerstreuung und liegt nur noch im positiven Bereich. Mit zunehmender <em>people_per_household</em> wird tendenziell ein höherer <em>median_house_value</em> mit dem Modell hervorgesagt, als tatsächlich vorliegt. Dies spiegelt sich auch im Plot zu Y and Fitted vs. X wieder. Bei dieser Variablen liegt somit Heteroskedastizität vor. Die Ursache hierfür könnte darin liegen, dass im höheren Wertebereich von <em>people_per_household</em> deutlich weniger Datensätze vorliegen als im niedrigeren Bereich und das Modell somit nicht ausreichend für diese Wertebereiche trainiert wurde. Womöglich bildet auch eine polynomiale Modellierung für diese Variable die Relation der Variablen besser ab.</p>

<p>Die Modellperformance liegt nun bei 74,3% und ist somit bisher der beste erzielte Wert der Kennzahl R-squared. <br>
F-statistics hat sich ebenfalls verbessert, auch im Vergleich zu Model 1. <br>
Alle anderen Werte liegen in einem ähnlichen Wertebereich.</p>

<p>Die Plots von <em>ocean_proximity[T.NEAR COAST]</em> zeigen keine große Veränderung zu Modell lm.</p>
<p>In der linearen Regression muss eine Colinearität der unabhängigen Variablen unbedingt vermieden werden. Mithilfe des Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) kann der Grad der Colinearität der im Modell verwendeten Variablen berechnet werden. Der kleinstmögliche Wert ist 1. Problematisch wird es ab Werten &gt; 5.</p>

<p>Der Wert der Konstanten kann ignoriert werden. Ansonsten ist die Colinearität der Variablen eher gering.</p>
<p>Die Modelle lm und lm2 sind sehr ähnlich. R-squared ist bei lm2 ca. 1% besser, dafür hat sich der Wert von F-statistics von lm zu lm2 um ca. 1000 verschlechtert. AIC und BIC haben sich nicht wesentlich verändert. Die Werte sind von lm zu lm2 sogar geringfügig kleiner (also besser) geworden, obwohl für zusätzliche Features ein Penalty Term einberechnet wird, um overfitting zu vermeiden. Das Partial Regression Plot der Variablen <em>median_housing_age</em> zeigt zwar nur eine geringe Linearität, dennoch scheint die Aufnahme der Variablen das Modell etwas zu verbessern.</p>

<p>Nun wird eine Cubic Spline unter Verwendung von Patsy und Statsmodels trainiert. Eine Verwendung von mehreren unabhängigen Variablen ist dabei nicht ohne Weiteres möglich. Daher wird nachfolgend lediglich die Variable mit der höchsten Korrelation zu <em>median_house_value</em> verwendet. Dabei handelt es sich um <em>median_income</em>.</p>

<p>Scikit Learn bietet eine eigene Methode zum Datensplitting. Das Datenset train_dataset2 aus statsmodels wird nun nochmal in Test- und Trainingsdaten aufgeteilt. Dadurch ist Validierung der Modelle bereits mit diesem Testset möglich, bevor am Ende dieses Notebooks mit den bereits zu Beginn zur Seite gelegten Testdaten das beste Modell evaluiert wird.</p>

<p>Das Modell hat einen ähnlichen R-squared wie die OLS Regression in statsmodels. Der Root Mean Squared Error des Modells beträgt 50968,88$. Das bedeutet, dass der eigentliche Wert von <em>median_house_value</em> im Schnitt um diesen Betrag von dem durch das Modell berechneten Ergebnis abweicht.</p>

<p>Der R-squared Wert hat sich mit den Validierungsdaten verbessert. Dies ist sehr ungewöhnliche, da unter Verwendung unbekannter Variablen die Metriken normalerweise etwas schlechtere Werte einnehmen. Dies könnte allerdings darin begründet sein, dass mit diesen Validierungsdaten bereits EDA, Feature Engineering und auch Cook’s Distance Outlier Entfernung durchgeführt wurde. <br>
Der durchschnittliche Fehler MSE und auch die durchschnittliche Abweichung von berechneten zu tatsächlichen Modellen sind etwas schlechter geworden. Allerdings nur geringfügig. Das Modell wird daher als gut erachtet.</p>

<p>R-squared der Lasso Regression hat sich im Vergleich zur Simple Regression im Modell zuvor nicht verändert. Auch MSE und RMSE sind gleich geblieben. Dies ist auf den initial gewählten, sehr kleinen Wert für alpha von 1 zurückzuführen. Ein geringer Wert in Alpha verändert die Höhe der Koeffizienten im Modell kaum. Daher bleiben auch die Berechnungen des Modells unverändert und somit die Metriken.</p>

<p>Das Diagramm visualiert die Feature Importance. Je länger der Balken, desto eine höhere Gewichtung bekommt das Feature im Modell. Die Feature Importance ergibt sich auch den Koeffizienten der Features. <em>median_income</em> ist das wichtigste Feature im Modell, wie an dem großen Balken sowie dem Koeffizienten des Features zu erkennen. <br>
Die Ausprägung <em>NEAR COAST</em> der Variablen <em>ocean_proximity</em> wurde von der Lasso Regression aus der Regression entfernt. Dieses Verhalten ist bei Lasso gewünscht. Durch die L1-Regularisierung mit alpha führt der Algorithmus automatisch eine Feature Selection durch. Dabei werden relevante Features durch höhere Koeffizienten stärker gewichtet und unwichtige Features durch kleinere Koeffizienten schäwcher gewichtet bzw. sogar komplett aus dem Modell entfernt, indem der Koeffizient auf den Wert 0 reduziert wird. Durch diese Methode soll ein overfitting des Modells durch zu viele Variablen verhindert werden.</p>

<p>Auf Basis von k-fold cross validation wurde der beste Wert für Alpha ermittelt. Dieser liegt bei 79,59. Bei k-fold cross validation wird das Trainingsdatenset nochmal in k kleinere Datensets unterteilt. Eines Dieser kleineren Datensets wird zur Seite gelegt und das Modell mithilfe der anderen und einem Wert für Alpha trainiert. Anschließend wird mit dem zur Seite gelegten kleinen Datenset eine Validierung des Modells mit den unbekannten Daten durchgeführt. <br>
Dieser Vorgang wird für jedes der k - Datensets für verschiedene Werte von Alpha wiederholt. Das Alpha mit dem besten Ergebnis bei der Validierung wird hier ausgegeben.</p>
<p>Mit dem zuvor ermittelten, besten Wert von Alpha wird nun noch ein finales Lasso Modell auf Basis aller Trainingsdaten trainiert.</p>

<p>R-squared ist in Model lm2 negativ. Somit generalisiert das Modell schlecht auf unbekannte Testdaten und stellt sogar eine Verschlechterung im Vergleich zur Verwendung des Durchschnitts als Modell dar. <br>
Grund dafür könnte ein Overfitting während dem Modellierungsprozess sein. <br>
Root Mean Squared Error und somit eine durchschnittliche Abweichung von tatsächlichem und berechnetem <em>median_house_value</em> in Höhe von 115678,95$ ist ebenso kein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis.</p>
<p>Die berechneten Werte sollen in einem Scatterplot den tatsächlichen Werten gegenübergestellt werden. Aufgrund der Datenmenge sollen nur einige Datensätze visualisiert werden. Mithilfe eines Data Splittings werden zufällig einige Datenpunkte ausgewählt.</p>

<p>Im Plot ist zu erkennen, dass bei bei einem <em>median_income</em> von 2 einen Datenpunkt gibt, dessen <em>median_house_value</em> negativ geschätzt wurde. Dieser Wert ist unplausibel, da ein Haus keinen negativen Wert hat. <br>
Den Koeffizienten des Modells lm2 ist zu entnehmen, dass nur das Feature <em>people_per_household</em> eine negative Abhängigkeit auf <em>median_house_value</em> hat. Die Ursache für einen negativen Wert wird also durch einen hohen Wert im Feature <em>people_per_household</em> verursacht.</p>

<p>Tatsächlich existiert ein Datensatz mit über 100 <em>people_per_household</em>. Dieser ist vermutlich für den negativen R-squared Wert verantwortlich. Daher wird dieser testweise entfernt und R-squared erneut berechnet.</p>

<p>Wie vermutet, lag der Grund für den negativen Wert in diesem Ausreiser.
Jedoch darf auf den Testdaten gemäß der Literatur keine EDA oder Feature Engineering betrieben werden. <br>
Das Modell lm2 ist daher kein gutes Modell, welches ausreichend unbekannte Daten generalisiert.</p>

<p>Den Analysen entsprechend ist das beste Modell ist die Spline von Scikit Learn mit einem R-squared der Testdaten von 65,25%. <br>
Gemäß dem Data-Science Lifecycle müsste dieses Modell jetzt deployed werden. Dieser Schritt wird allerdings nicht mehr im Rahmen dieses Projekts durchgeführt.</p>
